# Book-Library-
Book Library Using Node.js

**Task:**
- Develop a Book Library Service.
- Create REST APIs to support book management operations.
- Implement functionalities to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE books from a database.
- Utilize Node.js and Express.js for building the API server.
- Choose a database, preferably MongoDB or PostgreSQL, for data storage.

**Instructions:**
- Develop REST APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
- Implement the following four basic HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Use the GET method for retrieving all books or fetching a specific book by its unique identifier (ID).
- Employ the POST method to add a new book to the library.
- Utilize the PUT method for updating existing book information.
- Implement the DELETE method to remove a book from the library.
- Choose MongoDB or PostgreSQL as the database technology, with MongoDB being recommended.
- Ensure that the APIs are well-documented and follow best practices for API design.
- Consider creating a GitHub repository to host your code and a Postman collection to demonstrate the functionality of your APIs.
- Finally, create a video demonstration showcasing the usage of the APIs and submit it along with your code and Postman collection.
