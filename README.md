- Implemented functionalities to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE books from a database.
- Utilized Node.js and Express.js for building the API server.
- Choosed a database MongoDB for data storage.

**Instructions:**
- Develop REST APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
- Implemented the following four basic HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Used the GET method for retrieving all books or fetching a specific book by its unique identifier (ID).
- Employed the POST method to add a new book to the library.
- Utilized the PUT method for updating existing book information.
- Implemented the DELETE method to remove a book from the library.
- Choosed MongoDB as the database technology.
- Ensured that the APIs are well-documented and follow best practices for API design.
- Considered creating a GitHub repository to host my code and a Postman collection to demonstrate the functionality of my APIs.
